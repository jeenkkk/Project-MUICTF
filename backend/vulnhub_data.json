The goal of this vulnerable virtual machine is to present a lab where you can learn and practice to pivot through the subnets to be able to compromise all of the hosts/containers except 1.\nCTF Flag Information\nThis CTF challenge consists of a total of 20 flags. The virtual machine that is provided contains 2 flags and each docker image/container when running contains 3 additional flags with exception to 1 host. The 1 host that is the exception has no flags. (A mistake that I made was to name 2 flags the same.)\nThe structure of each flag is as follows: {{tryharder:xxx}}. The xxx in the example could be a single digit or up to 4 digits.\nNetwork Diagram\nBelow is a network diagram of the setup which may or may not be accurate. The virtual machine represents the firewall in the network diagram below. A total of 7 docker images/containers launch each time the virtual machine loads.\n\nDownload Information\nYou are able to download this file from my Google Drive at this link. The file is 2.7GB compressed with 7-zip. The file is a compressed OVF exported virtual machine from VMWorkstation 14. After importing the virtual machine, the first time that it loads will take upwards of 15 minutes due to building the environment and decompressing the docker images.

        "Description": "Trollcave is a vulnerable VM, in the tradition of Vulnhub and infosec wargames in general. You start with a virtual machine which you know nothing about \u2013 no usernames, no passwords, just what you can see on the network. In this instance, you'll see a simple community blogging website with a bunch of users. From this initial point, you enumerate the machine's running services and general characteristics and devise ways to gain complete control over it by finding and exploiting vulnerabilities and misconfigurations.\nYour first goal is to abuse the services on the machine to gain unauthorised shell access. Your ultimate goal is to read a text file in the root user's home directory root/flag.txt).\nThis VM is designed to be holistic and fairly down to earth. I wanted to simulate a real attack on a real website rather than just presenting a puzzle box of disparate elements, and I wanted to avoid the more esoteric vulnerable VMisms, like when you have to do signal processing on an MP3 you found to discover a port-knocking sequence. Of course there are always tradeoffs between what's realistic and what's optimally fun/challenging, but I've tried to keep the challenges grounded.\nBecause this is a VM that you're downloading, importing and booting, one way to achieve this goal would be to mount the VM's hard disk. I haven't encrypted the disk or done anything to prevent this, so if you want to take that route, go ahead. I'm also not offering a prize or anything for completing this VM, so know that it will be entirely pointless.\nBecause this is a VM running a real operating system with real services, there may be ways to get to root that I did not intend. Ideally, this should be part of the fun, but if they make the box entirely trivial I'd like to know about and fix them \u2013 within reason. As of this release, I've installed all the updates available for Ubuntu Server 16.04 LTS, but I cannot and will not attempt to patch this VM against every new Linux kernel exploit that comes out in the future. So there's a hint \u2013 you don't have to use a kernel exploit to root this box.\nWhat you will need is a good HTTP intercepting proxy \u2013 I recommend Burpsuite \u2013 and a couple of network tools like nmap and nc. You'll also need some virtualisation software \u2013 VirtualBox will be easiest for most people, but KVM and VMWare should also be able to import the .ova file after a bit of fiddling. Once you've imported the VM, put it on the same network as your attacking system (preferably don't give it internet access) and start hacking!\nYou can grab the .ova file here (929MB) (updated 2018-03-19). Let me know what you think.\n\nDoesn't work with VMware.\nChangelog\nv1.1 - 19/03/2018\nv1.2 - 21/03/2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nThis section is for various information that has been collected about the release, such as quotes from the webpage and/or the readme file.\nThese sources of information are usually helpful towards the completion of the release as the author can drop hints* as well as methods to help get the release up and working.\n\n\n* This is a 'little' hint.

Recently I came across an interesting command injection vector on a web application sitting on a client's internet-facing estate. There was a page, running in Java, that allowed me to type arbitrary commands into a form, and have it execute them. While developer-provided webshells are always nice, there were a few caveats. The page was expecting directory listing style output, which was then parsed and reformatted. If the output didn't match this parsing, no output to me. Additionally, there was no egress. ICMP, and all TCP/UDP ports including DNS were blocked outbound.\nI was still able to leverage the command injection to compromise not just the server, but the entire infrastructure it was running on. After the dust settled, the critical report was made, and the vulnerability was closed, I thought the entire attack path was kind of fun, and decided to share how I went about it.

I've tried to mix things up a little on this one, and have used the\nfeedback from #vulnhub to make this VM a little more challenging (I hope).\nSince you're not a Teuchter, I'll offer some hints to you:\nRemember TCP is not the only protocol on the Internet\nMy challenges are never finished with root. I make you work for the flags.\nThe intended route is NOT to use forensics or 0-days, I will not complain either way.\nTo consider this VM complete, you need to have obtained:\n\nTroll Flag: where you normally look for them\nFlag 1: You have it when you book Jennifer tickets to Paris on Pan Am.\nFlag 2: It will include a final challenge to confirm you hit the jackpot.\nHave root everywhere (this will make sense once you're in the VM)\nUser passwords\n2 VNC passwords\n\nBest of luck! If you get stuck, eat some EXTRABACON\nNB: Please allow 5-10 minutes or so from powering on the VM for background tasks to run\nbefore proceeding to attack.\nChangelog\n\nv0.1b - Initial Version\nv01.c - Fixes for flags based on feedback from mrB3n\nv0.1d - Fixes based on shortcut to intended route\nv0.2a - Fixes and clean up of disks for smaller OVA export\nv0.2b - Small edit to remove copy of flag in wrong folder\n\nSHA1SUM: D75AA2405E2DFB30C1470358EFD0767A10CF1EB1 analoguepond-0.2b.ova\nMany thanks to mrB3n, Rand0mByteZ and kevinnz for testing this CTF.\nA special thank you to g0tmi1k for hosting all these challenges and offering advice.

        "Description": "Welcome to The Pentester\u2019s 64-Bit AppSec Primer and challenge.\nHere at The Pentesters, we have a passion for application security and all that goes with it. We think that application security is an extremely important part of the field of information security and have, \u201cmade it our business\u201d so to speak to provide a means of education into modern-day application security. With modern computing becoming more and more advanced, and the requirements for understanding the functionality and security behind said computing becoming equally as challenging to understand, we figured that perhaps giving a set of challenges dedicated to learning the mere basics of 64 bit appsec would be beneficial to the security community. \nThe 64-Bit AppSec Primer consists of 16 challenges, increasingly more difficult than the previous one, dedicated to learning the basics of 64 bit binary exploitation and reverse engineering. The x64 instruction set, as you would expect, has many new instructions, registers, and calling conventions in comparison to the traditional x86 instruction set. Our goal, with this challenge, is to get you inside a debugger with intentionally vulnerable binaries, and get you looking at the inner-workings of a 64 bit binary. Alongside the increasing complexity of the instruction set, is an equally complexity of exploitation, which as a penetration tester and security engineer, will prove useful to understand.\nThe challenges consist of varying vulnerabilities and anti-debugger tricks in binaries, such as:\n\nStack-based Buffer Overflows\nFormat String Vulnerabilities\nHeap-based Buffer Overflows\nDetection of tracing\nInsecure validation of credentials\nand more\u2026 don\u2019t want to give you all the good details eh?\n\nAs a bonus, we would like to contribute back to the security community. We are donating the VM to Vulnhub, for all to have, and we are also offering prizes to three people who gives us the most robust and complete write-up for the challenges. In order to qualify for the prizes, you must post your write-up on either your personal blog, or website (your choice), and post a link to http://thepentesters.net/challenge/ along with your username. If you are unable to solve all of the challenges, that is okay, we will still accept your write-up for judging, we still want to see what you completed and how you did it. Here are the prizes:\n\n1st Place gets $150.00\n2nd Place gets $75.00\n3rd Place gets $25.00\n\nThe challenge ends on August 31st, 2016. All write-ups must be submitted by then, whoever has written the best write-up with the most detailed explanations wins. The judging will be done by our pentesting team.\nAlso, I would like to note a couple rules for the reverse engineering challenges.\n\nThe challenge must be solved without attacking the encryption of the flag. Spoiler, I used a basic XOR encryption for most of them so they do not show up in strings. So, that is off-limits. The goal is to break the logic of the application. \nSome challenges have several ways of solving and we would like to see how you did it. My C coding skills are most certainly not expertise, but I feel as if this will prove to be a good exercise for many in regards to exploit development and reverse engineering.\nAll else is fair game!\n\nNote: ASLR must be disabled, log in as level17:madpwnage, and run \u201cecho 0 > /proc/sys/kernel/randomize_va_space\u201d. Also, challenge 3, is only a DoS challenge. This is the beta, so there are still glitches. If you find any, please contact me at awile@thepentesters.net with your discovery.\nThere are a couple challenges that don\u2019t have \u201cflags\u201d but you will know when you have solved those, please note your findings and take screen-shots of them as well. As for the VM, you are to ssh in as user n00b and password n00b where you will find gdb-peda installed for you to make your life easier. The VM gets its IP through DHCP and is set to host-only adapter in VMware, so it should work for you straight out of the box so to speak. That is all I have for you and I hope you enjoy.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nThis section is for various information that has been collected about the release, such as quotes from the webpage and/or the readme file.\nThese sources of information are usually helpful towards the completion of the release as the author can drop hints* as well as methods to help get the release up and working.\n\n\n* This is a 'little' hint.

        "Description": "NETinVM\nA tool for teaching and learning about systems, networks and security\nAuthors: Carlos Perez & David Perez\nDate: 2016-11-03\nIntroduction\nNETinVM is a VMware virtual machine image that provides the user with a complete computer network. For this reason, NETinVM can be used for learning about operating systems, computer networks and system and network security.\nIn addition, since NETinVM is a VMware image, it can be used for demonstrations (i.e. in classrooms) that can be reproduced by students either in a laboratory or on their own laptop and thus, at home, at the library... For these reasons we present NETinVM as an educational tool.\nDescription of NETinVM\nNETinVM is a VMware virtual machine image that contains, ready to run, a series of User-mode Linux (UML) virtual machines. When started, the UML virtual machines create a whole computer network; hence the name NETinVM, an acronym for NETwork in Virtual Machine. This virtual network has been called 'example.net' and has fully qualified domain names defined for the systems: 'base.example.net', 'fw.example.net', etc.\nAll of the virtual machines use the Linux operating system. The VMware virtual machine is called 'base' and it runs openSUSE 13.2. User-mode Linux machines use Debian 6.0 and they have different names depending on their network location, because they are grouped into three different subnets: corporate, perimeter and external. The subnetworks are named 'int' (for internal network), 'dmz' (for DMZ or demilitarized zone, usually used as a synonym for perimeter network) and 'ext' (for external network).\nOne of the UML machines, 'fw', interconnects the three networks ('int, 'dmz' and 'ext'), allowing for communication and packet filtering. The rest of the UML machines have only one network interface, connected to the network they are named after:\nint<X>\n+ UMLs connected to the internal network.  can take values from 'a' to 'f', both inclusive. These machines only offer SSH service by default.\ndmz<X>\n+ UMLs connected to the perimeter network (DMZ). They are supposed to be bastion nodes. Two preconfigured bastion nodes are provided, each one with its appropriate alias:\n+ 'dmza' is aliased as 'www.example.net' and it offers HTTP and HTTPS services.\n+ 'dmzb' is aliased as 'ftp.example.net' and it offers FTP.\next<X>\n+ UMLs connected to the external network (ie: Internet).\nBecause a picture paints a thousand words, or so they say, the following figure shows NETinVM with all of the virtual machines running inside.\n\nGeneral view of NETinVM in VMware. The document example-net.pdf offers a detailed view. \nAll of the elements referenced before are shown in the image with their IP and ethernet addresses. The following rules have been used for assigning addresses:\n\nIP addresses are of the form 10.5.., where  is either 0 ('ext'), 1 ('dmz') or 2 ('int'), and  is either 10 for 'exta', 'dmza' or 'inta', 11 for 'b' and so on up to 15 for 'f'.\nNetwork masks are 24 bits (255.255.255.0).\nEthernet addresses are CA:FE:00:00:0:0, where  is either 0, 1 or 2 (following the same domain rule as IP addressing) and  is either a, b, c, d, e or f.\nThe interfaces of 'fw' use 254 for IP and FE for ethernet.\nThe interfaces of 'base' use 1 for IP and 01 for ethernet.\n\nIn addition to the computers and networks already described, the figure also shows the real computer where NETinVM runs ('REAL COMPUTER') and VMware Player's typical network interface ('vmnet8'), which optionally interconnects NETinVM's networks with the external word.\nWhen they boot, all UML virtual machines get their network configuration from 'base', which provides DHCP and DNS services to the three NETinVM networks through its interfaces 'tap0', 'tap1' and 'tap2'.\nRouting works as follows:\n\nThe default gateway for the internal and perimeter networks (machines 'int' and 'dmz') is 'fw' (more specifically, the IP address of 'fw' in the corresponding internal or perimeter subnet).\nThe default gateway for 'fw' is 'base' (its external network address).\n'base' (its external network address) is also the default gateway for machines in the external network ('ext'), but they are configured to use 'fw' (external network address) as the gateway for accessing machines in the perimeter and internal networks.\n'fw' applies NAT (SNAT, Masquerading) to all network traffic coming into it from the internal and perimeter networks and going out through its interface in the external network. So, these packets get to the external network with a source IP address of 10.5.0.254 (fw's IP address in the external network)\nThus, IP traffic exchanged among the three networks goes through 'fw', while traffic going out from NETinVM to the external world goes through 'fw' if (and only if) it comes from the internal or perimeter networks. All traffic going to the real world (outside NETinVM) exits through 'base' which, as 'fw' does, applies IP forwarding and NAT to this outgoing traffic.\n\nCommunication between 'base' and any UML machine, in both directions, is direct, without going through 'fw'. (When the communication is started from a UML machine, the IP address of the interface of 'base' in the corresponding network must be used.) This configuration permits access from 'base' to all UML machines using SSH independently of the packet filtering configuration at 'fw'.\nAs an additional consideration, please note that the SNAT configuration in 'fw' described above is necessary for responses to outgoing connections to the Internet originating from the internal or perimeter networks to come back through 'fw'. Otherwise they would be routed directly from 'base' to the UML machine through 'tap1' or 'tap2' without traversing 'fw'.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nThis section is for various information that has been collected about the release, such as quotes from the webpage and/or the readme file.\nThese sources of information are usually helpful towards the completion of the release as the author can drop hints* as well as methods to help get the release up and working.\n\n\n* This is a 'little' hint. Useful to help you get started and it shouldn't give anything away that you quickly could find out for yourself."

If you choose to use a physical box as the attacking machine, 'thewall' must exist on the same network via a bridged interface.\n\n\nThis works better with VirtualBox than VMware.\nNote, there is more to this than port scanning...\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nThis section is for various information that has been collected about the release, such as quotes from the webpage and/or the readme file.\nThese sources of information are usually helpful towards the completion of the release as the author can drop hints* as well as methods to help get the release up and working.\n\n\n* This is a 'little' hint.

        "Description": "The idea behind VulnVPN is to exploit the VPN service to gain access to the sever and \u2018internal\u2019 services. Once you have an internal client address there are a number of ways of gaining root (some easier than others).\nClient VPN Configuration\nI have created/uploaded the relevant files which can be obtained from the compressed file here. You\u2019ll need to configure Openswan/xl2tpd on your system, if you\u2019re using an Ubuntu based Linux variant you can follow the below steps \u2013 please note that I\u2019ve used Backtrack 5r3 for all client testing (mentioned as I know it works well):\n\n\napt-get install openswan xl2tpd ppp\n\n\nCopy the downloaded client files into the following locations:\n/etc/ipsec.conf\n/etc/ipsec.secrets\n/etc/ppp/options.l2tpd.client\n/etc/xl2tpd/xl2tpd.conf\n\n\nVulnVPN is located at 192.168.0.10 and the client configuration files state that the client IP address is 192.168.0.11.

And congratulations, for you have been selected as tribute!\nHacking games and CTF\u2019s are a lot of fun; who doesn\u2019t like pitting your skills against the gamemakers and having a free pass to break into things?\nBut watch out, as you will find out, some games are more dangerous than others. I have talked about counterattacks here before, and this system has implemented a number of aggressive anti-hacker measures.\nIn fact, this VM is downright evil. I am probably legally obligated to tell you that it will try to hack you. So if a calculator or message declaring your pwnedness pops up or shows up on your desktop, you asked for it. But don\u2019t worry, it won\u2019t steal your docs or rm you, it will just demonstrate compromise for the game.\nTo save precious bandwidth, this has been implemented in a minimal tinycore-based VM, and will require VirtualBox to run. But vbox is free \u2013 you can download it here: https://www.virtualbox.org/wiki/Downloads\nUnfortunately, I didn\u2019t have the time to add nearly all the things I wanted to, so there are really just a few challenges, a couple of counterhacks, and about 10 memes to conquer. Depending on your skill level, you could pwn (or be pwned) in just a few minutes or in a few hours. So hack it before it hacks you!\nNo sponsors are necessary, so don\u2019t light yourself on fire. Simply download the evil VM here: TheHackerGames.zip, start it, and open up http://localhost:3000/ to begin. Now, you can totally cheat since you own the VM, but see if you can beat the challenges without cheating. Then you can go ahead and cheat, which should also be fun \u2013 you\u2019re probably comfortable with many physical access attacks involving the hard disk, but this system doesn\u2019t use a hard disk. So enjoy and remember\u2026\nMay the odds be ever in your favor!\nSource: http://www.scriptjunkie.us/2012/04/the-hacker-games/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nThis section is for various information that has been collected about the release, such as quotes from the webpage and/or the readme file.\nThese sources of information are usually helpful towards the completion of the release as the author can drop hints* as well as methods to help get the release up and working.\n\n\n* This is a 'little' hint.

Here's a bit of information on pWnOS.\nIt's a linux virtual machine intentionally configured with exploitable services to provide you with a path to r00t. :) Currently, the virtual machine NIC is configured in bridged networking, so it will obtain a normal IP address on the network you are connected to. You can easily change this to NAT or Host Only if you desire. A quick ping sweep will show the IP address of the virtual machine. \nSorry...no scenario/storyline with this one. I wasn't really planning to release it like this, so maybe for version 2.0 I'll be more creative. :) I'm anxious to get feedback so let me know how it goes or if you have questions. Thanks and good luck!\nSource: http://forums.hackingdojo.com/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=149\n-- Readme\nThanks for trying pWnOS 1.0. A few things to note before getting started. pWnOS is made using VMware Workstation and can be started by downloading VMware Server or Vmware player...both of which are free! Or VMware Workstation (Windows) or VMware Fusion (OS X), which are not free.\n\nIf Vmware asks whether you copied or moved this virtual machine on first boot, click MOVED! Otherwise the network settings could get messed up. \nThe virtual machine is currently setup to use bridged networking, but you may want to change this to NAT or Host Only...depending on your preferences.\nAll necessary tools/exploits/whatever can be found at milw0rm.com. \nThere are multiple paths to get shell access. I created a n00b path and a more advanced path. See if you can get both of them!\n\nI would rate the difficulty of pWnOS approximately the same as De-Ice's level 2 disk...maybe a bit more difficult. See http://www.de-ice.net for information on the De-Ice penetration testing disks.\nI hope you enjoy it!

If someone wants more difficult challenges, I\u2019m sure the Inter-tubes holds them somewhere.\nOr you can always enroll in Offsec\u2019s PWB course. *shameless plug\n-- A few things I must say. I made this image using a new platform. Hoping everything works but I can\u2019t test for everything. Initially the VM had troubles getting an IP on boot-up. For some reason the NIC wouldn\u2019t go up and the machine was left with the loopback interface. I hope that I fixed the problem. Don\u2019t be surprised if it takes a little moment for this one to boot up. It\u2019s trying to get an IP. Be a bit patient.\nSomeone that tested the image for me also reported the VM hung once powered on. Upon restart all was fine. Just one person reported this, so hoping it\u2019s not a major issue. If you plan on running this on vmFusion, you may need to convert the imagine to suit your fusion version.\n-- Also adding the VHD file for download, for those using Hyper-V. You guys may need to change the network adapter to \u201cLegacy Network Adapter\u201d. I\u2019ve test the file and this one seems to run fine for me\u2026\nIf you\u2019re having problems, or it\u2019s not working for any reason email comms[=]kioptrix.com\nThanks to @shai_saint from www.n00bpentesting.com for the much needed testing with various VM solutions.\nThanks to Patrick from Hackfest.ca for also running the VM and reporting a few issues. And Swappage & @Tallenz for doing the same. All help is appreciated guys \nSo I hope you enjoy this one.\nThe Kioptrix Team\nSource: http://www.kioptrix.com/blog/?p=604\n\n**Note: Just a virtual hard drive.

        "Description": "-- S1.110\nSCENARIO\nThe scenario for this LiveCD is that a CEO of a small company has tasked you to do more extensive penetration testing of systems within his company. The network administrator has reconfigured systems within his network to meet tougher security requirements and expects you to fail any further penetration attempts. This system is an ftp server used by the network administrator team to create / reload systems on the company intranet. No classified or sensitive information should reside on this server. Through discussion with the administrator, you found out that this server had been used in the past to maintain customer information, but has been sanitized (as opposed to re-built). \nProve to the network administrator that proper system configuration is not the only thing critical in securing a server. \nCONFIGURATION\nPenTest Lab Disk 1.110: \nThis LiveCD is configured with an IP address of 192.168.1.110 - no additional configuration is necessary. \nPentest Machine:\nYour second system will use the BackTrack (v.2) LiveCD as provided by remote-exploit.org. A copy of the LiveCD can be downloaded from remote-exploit.org. This disk is configured to obtain an IP address through DHCP - thus no additional configuration is required. All tools necessary to exploit Disk 1.110 can be found on the BackTrack Disk. No additional installations will be necessary. \nRouter Configuration:\nThe PenTest Lab system and the PenTest machine must connect to a router that has been configured with the following values:\n+ DHCP Server: active\n+ Pool Starting Addr.: 192.168.1.2 \nLAN TCP/IP:\n+ IP Address: 192.168.1.1\n+ IP Subnet Mask: 255.255.255.0\nSource: http://forums.hackingdojo.com/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17\n-- Level 1\nWhere to get the current PenTest Lab Level 1 disks:\n192.168.1.100 = http://heorot.net/instruction/tutorials/iso/de-ice.net-1.100-1.1.iso\n192.168.1.110 = http://heorot.net/instruction/tutorials/iso/de-ice.net-1.110-1.0.iso\nThe MD5 Hash Values of Each Disk:\na3341316ca9860b3a0acb06bdc58bbc1 ==>de-ice.net-1.100-1.1.iso\na626d884148c63bfc9df36f2743d7242 ==>de-ice.net-1.110-1.0.iso \nWhere to get the scenario information for each disk:\n192.168.1.100 = http://forums.heorot.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=15\n192.168.1.110 = http://forums.heorot.net/viewtopic.php?f=16&t=17\nWhere to get the BackTrack disk:\nhttp://remote-exploit.org/backtrack_download.html\n(NOTE: version \"bt20061013.iso\" and \"BT2_Beta-Nov_19_2006.iso\" were used to exploit the PenTest disks.

The CEO, believing his company is secure, feels this is a huge waste of money, especially since he already has a company scan their network for vulnerabilities (using nessus). To make the BoD happy, he decides to hire you for a 5-day job; and because he really doesn't believe the company is insecure, he has contracted you to look at only one server - a old system that only has a web-based list of the company's contact information. \nThe CEO expects you to prove that the admins of the box follow all proper accepted security practices, and that you will not be able to obtain access to the box.

File size at the moment 822 MB, sorry for that but let the community decide what to kill!\nA short intro video will follow soon, maybe I can make it this weekend.\nSource: http://web.archive.org/web/20070911160224/http://blog.damnvulnerablelinux.org/2007/05/25/dvl-strychnine-final-available-very-soon-via-bittorrent-following-via-mirrors/\nSource: [http://web.archive.org/web/20090312135824/http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/index.php/eng/Damn%20Vulnerable%20Linux%20Distro/Damn%20Vulnerable%20Linux/Release%20Notes%20for%20Damn%20Vulnerable%20Linux%20(up%20to%20release%201.4](http://web.archive.org/web/20090312135824/http://www.damnvulnerablelinux.org/index.php/eng/Damn%20Vulnerable%20Linux%20Distro/Damn%20Vulnerable%20Linux/Release%20Notes%20for%20Damn%20Vulnerable%20Linux%20(up%20to%20release%201.4)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription\n\n\u00d7\n\n\n\nThis section is for various information that has been collected about the release, such as quotes from the webpage and/or the readme file.\nThese sources of information are usually helpful towards the completion of the release as the author can drop hints* as well as methods to help get the release up and working.\n\n\n* This is a 'little' hint.
